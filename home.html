                HAPPY BIRTHDAY! <span class="reading-font">Yukizu-tan, well, I am not that good at anything related to art, but this is a little something from me. I hope you like it.
                I wouldst convey mine own heartfelt gratitude, not merely as a companion in the noble craft of scanlation, but as a cherished friend who hath journeyed far and now standeth in the realm of MANGA and ANIME. Verily, AND I also enjoyed all the  game sessions full of joy and revelry. Indeed, I eagerly anticipate many more such endeavors in the days to come , if i am not broke . </span>

                I thank thee for being my steadfast companion in our Genshin ventures though you have busy lately so i hope you can relax sometimes ; thy presence doth lighten the burden when the grind becomes wearisome, and it bringeth me joy to witness both playing and sometimes losing 50/50.

                Now that thou hast completed thy studies and embarked upon thy new vocation, I am grateful beyond measure for the support thou hast shown me as a friend. Thy guidance have been a light in mine own journey, and for that, I am deeply thankful. Shouldst thou ever require aid or counsel, know that I am here, ready to lend mine ear and hand whenever thou hast need , WISH YOU ALL THE BEST FOR YOUR JOURNEY<br> SANA <br> SANA <br>
